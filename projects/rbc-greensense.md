## Project Overview

RBC GreenSense is a mobile app at the intersection of finance, ecommerce, and environmental consciousness. Aimed at transforming consumer behavior, the app leverages the popularity of mobile banking and the evolving landscape of the RBC reward program to encourage environmentally conscious decision making among consumers.

**Goal:** to enhance RBC's Rewards program to guide consumers towards more conscious environmental decisions.

_\*This project was runner-up at [ElleHacks](https://ellehacks.com/)._

## Consumer Insights

1. Growing preference for convenient banking technologies in Canada.
2. Substantial increase in mobile banking usage, especially among Millennials.
3. Projected rise in mobile transactions, with Millennials being three times more reliant on mobile banking than older generations.
4. High satisfaction levels with mobile banking, with room for improvement in simplicity and reliability.
5. Majority of Canadians express eco-friendly behaviors, influenced by factors like convenience, conscience, and peer influence.

## Solution

RBC GreenSense addresses non-green consumership by combining education and empowerment within the existing RBC Rewards structure. The app introduces gamification elements such as competitiveness, augmented reality, a rank system, and community engagement. This approach strategically encourages environmentally conscious consumer decisions while promoting the usage of the RBC Rewards system, benefiting both users and RBC alike.

## Key Features

- **Gamified Experience:** Incorporates gaming elements to make eco-conscious choices rewarding and enjoyable.
- **AR:** Enhances user engagement through interactive and immersive experiences.
- **Ranking System:** Encourages friendly competition and progression in environmental awareness.
- **Community Engagement:** Fosters a sense of shared responsibility and collective impact.
