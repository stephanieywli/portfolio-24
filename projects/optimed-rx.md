## Project Overview

optiMed RX is a web app tailored to address critical challenges within the healthcare industry. With a primary goal of optimizing patient care, optiMed RX streamlines the interaction between pharmacists and patients, providing an innovative solution to enhance medication management and overall healthcare outcomes.

This user-friendly online platform was designed to facilitate seamless communication between patients and pharmacists, offering a range of features to improve medication management and healthcare delivery.

_\*This project won first place at [UWaterloo HackRX](https://www.accelevents.com/e/hackrx2022)._

## Problem Statement

1. Patients often lack up-to-date medication lists for appointments.
2. Pharmacists face workflow constraints, limiting their ability to practice to the full extent.
3. Increased healthcare costs, particularly in heart failure cases, without pharmacist intervention.
4. Pharmacists may not be comfortable suggesting newer medications, impacting patient care.

## Solution

optiMed RX resolves these issues by:

- Simplifying appointment scheduling for patients and pharmacists.
- Enabling pharmacists to bill for MedChecks and pharmaceutical opinions.
- Facilitating the maintenance of up-to-date medication lists for patients.
- Increasing pharmacist involvement in the treatment process.
- Recommending evidence-based medications to patients.

## Impact

1. **Optimized Medication:** Patients' medications are tailored to their conditions and symptoms, enhancing overall health outcomes.
2. **Efficient Documentation:** Output for fax includes Pharmaceutical Opinions and Medication Lists, streamlining communication between healthcare providers.
3. **Strengthened Relationships:** Pharmacists build stronger relationships and trust with patients through increased involvement in their healthcare journey.
4. **Financial Benefits:** Pharmacists can bill for Pharmaceutical Opinions, leading to a more sustainable and profitable practice.
