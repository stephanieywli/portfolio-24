Created with the team at [TEDxToronto](https://www.tedxtoronto.com/).

## Project Overview

The TEDxToronto Website project aimed to rejuvenate the online presence by developing a strategic web project plan, collaborating with the TEDxToronto team to understand diverse web needs, and inventorying valuable content from past websites.

This initiative sought to create a dynamic platform that effectively communicated TEDxToronto's mission and values for their RENEW event in 2022.
